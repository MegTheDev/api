              description:'<p>Jeff Dalton, Chief Evangelist at AgileCxO.org, CEO of Broadsword Solutions</p> <p>2019 will be the year of Big Agile, where large adopters like General Motors, the Department of Defense, the State of Michigan, Lockheed Martin, and others, who have combined IT budgets exceeding 100 Billion dollars, have all announced their desire to “go agile” at a scale not yet seen in our community. Are technology leaders who cut their teeth in a low-trust, command-and-control, high-documentation environment prepared to make a successful transformation? What will Big Agile look like, and how will it affect the rest of the community?</p> <p>Jeff Dalton thinks this is will be our industry’s biggest challenge, and he’s been studying it for years. As the large adopters in the federal government and corporate sector begin to adopt agile, they’ll bring their habits, culture, and bureaucracies with them, and in dozens of podcasts, articles, books, and keynote speeches Jeff has been talking about getting in front of the wave. His latest book, “Great Big Agile: An OS for Agile Leaders” is available on Amazon, and he has written for CIO Magazine, CIO Online, Better Software Magazine, and the Cutter IT Business Journal on agile leadership in a large-scale environment.</p> <p>A veteran technologist and IT leader, Jeff started as a software developer and has been a CEO, Chief Technology Executive, VP of Product Development, Director of Quality and Agile Evangelist for over 30 years including time with Ernst and Young, Electronic Data Systems, Hewlett Packard, Intellicorp, Polk, Broadsword, and AgileCxO.</p> <p>As a consultant, teacher, CMMI lead appraiser, and leadership coach he has worked with NASA, Boeing, Accenture, Bose, L3 Communications, Fiat Chrysler Automotive, General Motors, Ford, and various federal and state agencies to help them improve performance. He is a frequent keynote speaker, Agile Performance Holarchy Assessor, blogger, and host of “The Agile Leadership Podcast,” a monthly series that interviews CIOs from State Government about the challenges of agile adoption.</p> <p>In his spare time Jeff is an instrument rated pilot and plays bass in a jazz band.</p>',

What will Big Agile look like, and how will it affect the rest of the community?</p> <p>Jeff Dalton thinks this is will be our industry’s biggest challenge, and he’s been studying it for years. As the large adopters in the federal government and corporate sector begin to adopt agile, they’ll bring their habits, culture, and bureaucracies with them, and in dozens of podcasts, articles, books, and keynote speeches Jeff has been talking about getting in front of the wave. His latest book, “Great Big Agile: An OS for Agile Leaders” is available on Amazon, and he has written for CIO Magazine, CIO Online, Better Software Magazine, and the Cutter IT Business Journal on agile leadership in a large-scale environment.</p> <p>A veteran technologist and IT leader, Jeff started as a software developer and has been a CEO, Chief Technology Executive, VP of Product Development, Director of Quality and Agile Evangelist for over 30 years including time with Ernst and Young, Electronic Data Systems, Hewlett Packard, Intellicorp, Polk, Broadsword, and AgileCxO.</p> <p>As a consultant, teacher, CMMI lead appraiser, and leadership coach he has worked with NASA, Boeing, Accenture, Bose, L3 Communications, Fiat Chrysler Automotive, General Motors, Ford, and various federal and state agencies to help them improve performance. He is a frequent keynote speaker, Agile Performance Holarchy Assessor, blogger, and host of “The Agile Leadership Podcast,” a monthly series that interviews CIOs from State Government about the challenges of agile adoption.</p> <p>In his spare time Jeff is an instrument rated pilot and plays bass in a jazz band.</p>',

        description: '<p>Jeff Dalton, Chief Evangelist at AgileCxO.org, CEO of Broadsword Solutions</p> <p>2019 will be the year of Big Agile, where large adopters like General Motors, the Department of Defense, the State of Michigan, Lockheed Martin, and others, who have combined IT budgets exceeding 100 Billion dollars, have all announced their desire to “go agile” at a scale not yet seen in our community. Are technology leaders who cut their teeth in a low-trust, command-and-control, high-documentation environment prepared to make a successful transformation? What will Big Agile look like, and how will it affect the rest of the community?</p> <p>Jeff Dalton thinks this is will be our industry’s biggest challenge, and he’s been studying it for years. As the large adopters in the federal government and corporate sector begin to adopt agile, they’ll bring their habits, culture, and bureaucracies with them, and in dozens of podcasts, articles, books, and keynote speeches Jeff has been talking about getting in front of the wave. His latest book, “Great Big Agile: An OS for Agile Leaders” is available on Amazon, and he has written for CIO Magazine, CIO Online, Better Software Magazine, and the Cutter IT Business Journal on agile leadership in a large-scale environment.</p> <p>A veteran technologist and IT leader, Jeff started as a software developer and has been a CEO, Chief Technology Executive, VP of Product Development, Director of Quality and Agile Evangelist for over 30 years including time with Ernst and Young, Electronic Data Systems, Hewlett Packard, Intellicorp, Polk, Broadsword, and AgileCxO.</p> <p>As a consultant, teacher, CMMI lead appraiser, and leadership coach he has worked with NASA, Boeing, Accenture, Bose, L3 Communications, Fiat Chrysler Automotive, General Motors, Ford, and various federal and state agencies to help them improve performance. He is a frequent keynote speaker, Agile Performance Holarchy Assessor, blogger, and host of “The Agile Leadership Podcast,” a monthly series that interviews CIOs from State Government about the challenges of agile adoption.</p> <p>In his spare time Jeff is an instrument rated pilot and plays bass in a jazz band.</p> ',
